                Planning to build a brand or a product, especially tech products, and looking for someone with demonstrated work

                management methodologies incorporating industry standards and beyond tools and trends for the past few years. Making 
                a product roadmap, integrating with SDLC, designing the User Experience & Customer Experience, Business Analysis, 
                Marketing Planning, and Communication with a cup of coffee is my hand; that looks like a typical day for me. If you
